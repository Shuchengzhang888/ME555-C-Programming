Examine the provided "broken.c" file, which has some errors in it.  
(Hint: you might execute it by hand)
Find, and list these errors in a file called "answer.txt".
The format of your answer file should be one line per error with
the line number, followed by a space, followed by one of the following
phrases describing the error:

  return dangling pointer
  use of dangling pointer
  index out of bounds
  use of uninitialized value

Some notes:  
- The errors should be listed in the order that you encounter them during
  the execution of the program.
- It's possible that a loop will have one error on one iteration, and 
  a different error in a subsequent iteration.  In this case, write each
  line number and error description on a separate line in the order in which
  they are encountered during execution.
- If you use an illegal value, after you note the error, you may assume 
  it evaluated to 0 to continue executing your code.

For example, your answer.txt might  look like this (although this is,
of course, not the correct answer):

2 return dangling pointer
4 use of dangling pointer
7 use of uninitialized value
8 use of uninitialized value
7 index out of bounds
8 index out of bounds

Note that a correct answer will have 6 lines and use every type of
error listed above at least once.
